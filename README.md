# Build Portfolio

## Intro
I built and trained on singleplayer and private servers. My name is Alex, and I'm a 13 years old with a passion for Minecraft. Despite my young age, I've already gained valuable experience in the world of Minecraft building. I love expressing my creativity through intricate designs and constructing unique landscapes within the game

## The builds

### The Hill:

Altough I get a lot of help from my brother, I mostly play on my creative singleplayer worlds where I unleash my creativity and my passion for landscapes and medieval styles

Sadly, I cannot provide with the latest screenshots but the in build progress is still present

### Medieval Village

This one started in 1.16.5 with my brother but after a corruption, I stumbled on a backup in my email before restarting from scratch, it's still a WIP but not an abandoned project
